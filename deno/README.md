# Deno Template

This template is for Deno projects.
Should help you get started with a Deno project.

The template is based on the [Deno Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/denoland/deno/).

You can define your ENV variables in the `global` property of the template.yml file.

In the `commands` property, this is a property called `commands`. In `commands`, you will see the basic commands that are needed to install, build and test your project.
