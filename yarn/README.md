# Node.JS Template

This template is for Node.JS projects.
Should help you get started with a Node.JS project.

The template is based on the [Node.JS Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).

You can define your ENV variables in the `global` property of the template.yml file.

In the `commands` property, this is a property called `commands`. In `commands`, you will see the basic commands that are needed to install, build and test your project.

This template assumes you are using `yarn` and that the run commands defined in the pipeline are defined in your `package.json` file.
