# Nosana Pipeline Templates

This repository is a collection of standard pipeline configurations,
which can be directly used in your `.nosana-ci.yml` file.

These are to be used for setting up a pipeline for a project.
They are not complete pipelines, but rather starting points to build your pipeline.
These will need to be customized for each project.
But should serve as a good starting point, and help you get started with your pipeline today.
