# Nosana Pipeline Templates

This repository contains standard pipeline configurations that can be used directly in your '.nosana-ci.yml' file.

You can use these to create a project pipeline. They are not finished pipelines, but rather starting points for your own. These will need to be tailored to your specific project. They should, however, serve as a good starting point and assist you in getting started with your pipeline today.
