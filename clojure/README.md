# Clojure Template

This template is for Clojure projects.

The template is based on the [Clojure Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/clojure/).

You can define your ENV variables in the `global` property of the template.yml file.

In the `commands` property, this is a property called `commands`. In `commands`, you will see the basic commands that are needed to install, build and test your project.
In this template, we also showcase how to install and use `clj-kondo`.
