# Python Template

This template is for Python projects.
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, open-source programming language.

The template is based on the [Python Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/).

You can define your ENV variables in the `global` property of the template.yml file.

In the `commands` property, this is a property called `commands`. In `commands`, you will see the basic commands that are needed to install, build and test your project.
